My name is Esteban. I am a software developer and entrepreneur. 

I am currently the CEO & Co-founder at [Watermelon](https://www.watermelontools.com/) where we're building a passive documentation search engine, serving both our GitHub app and VS Code extension. 

Our set of plug-ins index the most relevant information from sources such as GitHub, Slack, Linear, and Notion that are tied to a given Pull Request or file of code.
