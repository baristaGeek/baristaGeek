My name is Esteban. I am a software developer and entrepreneur. 

I am currently the CEO & Co-founder at [Watermelon](https://www.watermelontools.com/) where we're building a set of plug-ins to improve code review by enriching the process with business context. 

Watermelon provides a VS Code Extension and a GitHub Application. For a given PR or block of code, these tools index the most relevant information from sources such as GitHub, Slack, Linear, and Notion.
